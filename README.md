USGS brings an array of earth, water, biological, and mapping data and expertise to bear in support of decision-making on environmental, resource, and public safety issues.

USGS was adopted by Congress in 1879 to provide and bring awareness of earth's climate to the public

NOTE: The U.S. Geological Survey works with many partners to provide objective and impartial science to resource managers, emergency response, and the public.

Here are the fact about the USGS: 
  
  Lead the Nation in 21st-century integrated research, assessments, and prediction of natural resources and processes to meet society’s needs.
  
  The USGS monitors, analyzes, and predicts current and evolving Earth-system interactions and delivers actionable information at scales and timeframes relevant to decision makers.
  
  The USGS is a primary Federal source of science-based information on ecosystems, land use, energy and mineral resources, natural hazards, water use and availability, and updated maps and images of the Earth’s features available to the public.

In this repository built an geo-mapping visualization that can track earthquakes based on location, magnitude, depth and coordinates

Data source is fed via D3 JSON to read the earthquake data (Source: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

I've also added additional layers on the map first including the earthquake occurences and second one is the fault lines that allows to track the tectonic plates



**Note: source mapping from the techonic plates: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master

Added the bind popup feature that displays the location, magnitude and depth by clickin on the marker (see fig below)
